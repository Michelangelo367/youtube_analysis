# Youtube Analysis

This repo contains scripts to pull data from the YouTube API, clean the data, and perform a basic analysis of the data. This code was created to support the [Media Manipulation Initiative](https://datasociety.net/research/media-manipulation/) at Data & Society. Feel free to use my code to perform an analysis of other youtube data!
